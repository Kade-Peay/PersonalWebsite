# What Do I Want This to Do?
I'd ideally like this to showcase a little about me and some of my favorite
projects that I've ever worked on.

I'd like to run this on a Raspberry Pi and be able to serve this to the web. This 
way I can put a link to it on my resume.

# How Do I do it?
I could use something like django, that might help me scale the project. However,
I really don't like using Django. It might be better for me to use something like Vue. 

This is something I will have to think on, because the last thing I want to do is
refactor the whole project after I've almost finished.

Djanog might be better for importing old projects though, and would likely help
with adding onto the site after the fact.

# What Projects Should I showcase?
I'd like 5-10 projects showcased, depending on the size of them.

Obviously I can't put any of my projects in which I followed a tutorial, that's cheating.
School projects should be fine.

Do I try to run these in the browser?
	No, at most I would link to the github, otherwise I should just use screenshots and maybe a video for each.
