				Welcome, my name is Kade Peay and I'm a computer science student at Utah State University. I built this website myself, so if it looks bad,
				I'll blame the fact that I'm a programmer and not a designer. I enjoy movies, poetry, video games, and ice cream. I've tried to put some of my
				projects on this page, feel free to look around. If they don't have a link to the src code, that's because it was a school project and I
				really don't want to get sued.
