		<h2>This is a very simple command line tic tac toe game!</h2>
		<p>Composed of 171 lines of poorly written, weirdly formatted code; it was one of my first projects I did in python.</p>
		<p>This has no A.I. for the enemy player, is only one player, and works by picking a number between 1 and 9 to choose where to put your 'X'</p>
		<p>
			Of course if you'd like to learn more, you are always welcome to check out it's github page here:

		</p>
		<h3>How it works</h3>
		<p>It works in a simple way, start with a 2-dimensional array and print that to the console:</p>
		<pre id="code" style="width: fit-content"><code>def boardinit():
	board = [['1', '2', '3'],
	['4', '5', '6'],
	['7', '8', '9']]
	return board

def printBoard(arr):
	for row in arr:
		print(row)</code></pre>
		<p>
			Now we get to the best bit of code, the function for the players turn. This is just a laundry list of if/elif statements. Each of these
			correspond to a certain position in the array. It checks if an 'X' or 'O' is in that position, if not, it places the 'X'.
		</p>
		<pre id="code" style="width: fit-content"><code># Make this a choice between 1 and 9
def playerTurn():
    print("Choose Number between 1 and 9")
    choice = input("Enter number: ")

    if choice == '1':
        x = 0
        y = 0
    elif choice == '2':
        x = 0
        y = 1
    elif choice == '3':
        x = 0
        y = 2
    elif choice == '4':
        x = 1
        y = 0
    elif choice == '5':
        x = 1
        y = 1
    elif choice == '6':
        x = 1
        y = 2
    elif choice == '7':
        x = 2
        y = 0
    elif choice == '8':
        x = 2
        y = 1
    elif choice == '9':
        x = 2
        y = 2
    else:
        print('Invalid input')

    if board[x][y] == 'O' or board[x][y] == 'X':
        print("That spot is taken")
        playerTurn()
    else:
        board[x][y] = 'X'</code></pre>
		<p>
			Next function is the computer turn function. This is a very simple and straight forward algorith. As I've stated before, this employs absolutely
			no A.I. it is just random numbers to pick a position on the board.
		</p>
		<pre id="code" style="width: fit-content"><code>def compTurn():
            x = random.randint(0,2)
            y = random.randint(0, 2)
            
            if board[int(x)][int(y)] != 'X':
            board[int(x)][int(y)] = 'O' 
            else: compTurn()
        </code></pre>
		<p>
			<em
				>* Note that I found a bug that I may or may not have known about when I made this (I'm cutting myself slack seeing as it was 2 years ago)
				where if there is an 'X' where the computer chooses to put it's 'O' it just doesn't make a move.</em
			>
		</p>
		<p>
			The worst bit of code is here. This is the function that checks for a winning position. It has 6 checks. It checks the Horizontal, Vertical, and
			Diagonal for both 'X' (and the odly named) 'Y'
		</p>
		<p>
			I believe I labeled it 'Y' because of the x and y cartesian coordinate system I was using for the game board. In fact this may be why 'O' can't
			win. Regardless here is how it works:

			Being older and wiser, I would probably find a better solution to do this. Or I would realize that this was a project I spent a single day on
			and finding a smarter way to do this would actually overall be a waste of time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Regardless now we come to the final important piece of the puzzle, and that is the main game "loop." I say "loop" because it actually doesn't
			loop. Once you win it doesn't start a new game. This would be an easy enough fix, and perhaps I'll do that later when I have more time and
			drive.
		</p>
		<p>
			It's very straight forward: print who's turn, allow for player or computer input, check if anyone has won, print the board, and do it again.
		</p>
		<pre id="code" style="width: fit-content"><code># I am going to use this to loop over the game
def game():
    print()
    print("Your Turn!")
    playerTurn()
    check()
    print("Computer's Turn!")
    compTurn()
    check()
    printBoard(board)
    print()
    game()</code></pre>
		<p>Firstly we have the main function, which just prepares the game board, and prints it initially, and calls the main game loop function.</p>
		<pre id="code" style="width: fit-content"><code>if __name__ == "__main__":
    board = boardinit()
    print()
    printBoard(board)
    game()</code></pre>
		<p>
			And that's all there is to this very simple game. I was still new when I made it, and maybe once I'm done building this site I will go back and
			change some of the things that are blatently wrong, and easy to fix.
