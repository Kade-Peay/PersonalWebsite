			This is a simple web app that finds the most current weather on Mars using data from Nasa's Curiosity Rover, and the most recent picture from
			the Rover. Then it also gets the weather for wherever you are, and also using Nasa, gets a sattelite picture of where you are.
		</h2>
		<p>
			This was a fun week long project I did over christmas break. There are quite a few bugs, such as the picture of the users current area doesn't
			always work.
		</p>
		<p>I would link the github page, but it has some api keys in it so it is private, but all of the important code will be shown on this page.</p>
		<h3>How It Works:</h3>
		<p>
			This is a vue app that is largely dependent on JavaScript to manage the DOM, with very little actual HTML doing anything (typical html). The
			only thing that the HTML does here is a placeholder for the data when it comes through.
		</p>
		<p>Because of that fact I'm not going to go over the HTML, because it's not very important, instead let's just go over how the JS works.</p>
		<p>First we build the Vue app:</p>
		<pre id="code"><code>const vm = Vue.createApp({</code></pre>
		<p>Then we instantiate the data that will be needed later:</p>
		<pre id="code"><code>data() {
	return {
		lat: undefined,
		lon: undefined,
		city: undefined,
		state: undefined,
		country: undefined,
		today: new Date(),
		current: undefined,
		earthPicture: undefined,
		sol: undefined,
		marsTemp: undefined,
		marsPA: undefined,
		marsWind: undefined,
		marsSeason: undefined,
		fUTC: undefined,
		lUTC: undefined,
		marsPicture: undefined,
	};</code></pre>
		<p>
			Next we use the "mounted" function is vue, this calls the JS as soon as the DOM is finished loading. From there we use our first fetch and this
			gets the location information of the user.
		</p>
		<pre id="code"><code> mounted() {
	fetch("https://api.freegeoip.app/json/?apikey=[enter your own api]")
		.then(response => response.json())
		.then(json => {
			this.lat = json.latitude;
			this.lon = json.longitude;
			this.state = json.region_name;
			this.country = json.country_name;
			this.city = json.city;

			console.log("lat " + this.lat);
			console.log("lon " + this.lon);
			return fetch(`https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=${this.lat}&lon=${this.lon}&appid=[enter your own api]&units=imperial`);
	})</code></pre>
		<p>
			As you can see at the end there is another fetch request. That is because we are using promise chaining to make sure all the data comes in as we
			want. So the next few segments are going to continue off the last one, bear with me here.
		</p>
		<p>The next fetch grabs the current weather data for the users current area:</p>
		<pre id="code"><code> .then(response => response.json()) 
	.then(json => {
		this.current = json;

		return fetch(`https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/earth/imagery?lon=${this.lon}&lat=${this.lat}&dim=0.15&date=2021-01-01&api_key=[enter your own api]`)
})</code></pre>
		<p>You may notice that this just adds it to a variable named "current," that's because I'm allowing the HTML to handle which data goes where:</p>
		<pre id="code"><code>&lt;li&gt;Currently: {{current.main.temp}} F&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High: {{current.main.temp_max}} F&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;Low: {{current.main.temp_min}} F&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{current.weather[0].description}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{current.main.humidity}}% humidity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{current.main.pressure}} hPa pressure&lt;/li&gt;</code></pre>
		<p>So now we have all the current weather for the area, let's get a picture for that area:</p>
		<pre id="code"><code>.then(response => response.blob())
	.then(imageBlob => {
		// Then create a local URL for that image and print it 
		this.earthPicture = URL.createObjectURL(imageBlob);
		console.log(this.earthPicture);
});</code></pre>
		<p>
			The only problem with this code is that it is not reliable. It only works some of the time and that's just due to what is available. As well as
			that most of the pictures are huge, so trying to scale it down doesn't always work great.
		</p>
		<p>
			So our first set of fetch requests is done. This handles only the current weather conditions for the local area of the user. But I also wanted
			to get the most recent weather data for Mars, and that is it's own set of only 2 fetch requests. Starting with:
		</p>
		<pre id="code"><code>fetch("https://api.nasa.gov/insight_weather/?api_key=[enter your own api]&feedtype=json&ver=1.0")
	.then(response => response.json())
	.then(json => {
		// in here is where I need to put the data for mars weather
		this.sol = json.sol_keys[0];
		this.marsTemp = json[this.sol].AT.av; // atmospheric temperature, celsius
		this.marsPA = json[this.sol].PRE.av; // atmospheric pressure, Pascals
		this.marsWind = json[this.sol].HWS.av; // horizontal wind speed, meters per second
		this.marsSeason = json[this.sol].Season;
		this.fUTC = json[this.sol].First_UTC; // first data point of sol
		this.lUTC = json[this.sol].Last_UTC; // last data point of sol

		return fetch(`https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?sol=${this.sol}&api_key=[enter your own api]`)
})</code></pre>
		<p>Then we use our next fetch to grab a picture from the rover:</p>
		<pre id="code"><code>.then(response => response.json())
	.then(json => {
		this.marsPicture = json.photos[0].img_src;
});</code></pre>
		<p>To end it all, since we are using vue we have to mount the app:</p>
		<pre id="code"><code>}).mount("#app");</code></pre>
		<p>
			With all that we are done. We have weather data for our current location, and a picture of where we are. We also have Mars' most recent weather
			data, as well as a picture from the Rover.
		</p>
		<p>Of course I didn't share all of the HTML because that seemed exhaustive but it's pretty straight forward how it works.</p>
