		<h2>This is a simple python script that organizes the downloads file on Windows.</h2>
		<p>
			If you use windows you know, the downloads folder is terrible. Anything you download from a browser, is just chucked into this folder to die a
			disorganized death. It bothered me so much, so I wrote this script that moves files into appropriate folders.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now this may not be the most impressive, or sophisticated project I've ever done, but it is my favorite project I've ever done, and I use it
			very often.
		</p>

		</p>

			How it works is very simple. See what file type it is, move it to a specific folder. I just check the .__contains__ and check if it's .jpg,
			.exe, etc. But let's step through the project and see the specifics.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>First let's deal with some imports needed to move the files</p>
		<pre id="code"><code>#!/usr/bin/env Python3
import os, shutil</code></pre>
		<p>Next let's define where the Download folder is, and make an array of the files contained within:</p>
		<pre id="code"><code>path = 'C:/Users/Kade/Downloads/'
arr = os.listdir(path)</code></pre>
		<p>
			Next we define the folders to move the files to. All but one of these is predefined in Windows, the only one needed is the 'Applications'
			folder. Of course if you are copying this, make sure to change these:
		</p>
		<pre id="code"><code>doc = 'C:/Users/Kade/Documents/'
pic = 'C:/Users/Kade/Pictures/Saved Pictures/'
app = 'C:/Users/Kade/Applications/'
sound = 'C:/Users/Kade/Sound/'
video = 'C:/Users/Kade/Videos/'</code></pre>
		<p>Now that the setup is done, we are ready to loop through every file in the Downloads folder:</p>
		<pre id="code"><code>for file in arr:
	# this ignores image used in file explorer view
	if file == 'desktop.ini':
		pass

	elif file.__contains__('.exe'): # If it is an executable, move it to the applications folder
		shutil.move(path + file, app + file)
		print('Moved ' + file + ' to ' + app + '\n')

	elif file.__contains__('.jpg') or file.__contains__('.png') or file.__contains__('.jfif'): # If it is a picture, move to the pictures folder
		shutil.move(path + file, pic + file)
		print('Moved ' + file + ' to ' + pic + '\n')

	elif file.__contains__('.doc') or file.__contains__('.pdf') or file.__contains__('pptx'): # If it is a document, move to document folder
		shutil.move(path + file, doc + file)
		print('Moved ' + file + ' to ' + doc + '\n')

	elif file.__contains__('.wav') or file.__contains__('.mp3') or file.__contains__('m4a'): # If it is a sound, move to sound folder
		shutil.move(path + file, sound + file)
		print('Moved ' + file + ' to ' + sound + '\n')
	
	elif file.__contains__('.mp4'):
		shutil.move(path + file, video + file)
		print('Moved ' + file + ' to ' + video + '\n')

	else:
		print('file ' + file + ' is not specified where to move\n')</code></pre>
		<p>
			Alright let's break down what this is doing specifically. First we ignore the 'desktop.ini' file. This is a default hidden file, and as such we
			don't really want to move that. Next we just go through different file types, and every few months if I run into a new file type I add it to the
			list. Then if it isn't specified we don't move it. This is mostly used for another folder, as it's hard to determine where exactly to put an
			entire folder.
		</p>
		<p>
			That's all there is. Like I said it's a very simple project, and didn't take me very long to make but I use it all the time to keep my computer
			organized.
